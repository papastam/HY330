# Telecommunications _([HY330](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy330))_

For the course of Telecommunications, we used [GNU Radio](https://www.gnuradio.org/) to implement a simple communication systems. Through the assignments of the course we used different types of signals, such as sines, square waves, triangular waves, sawtooth waves, etc. We also used different types of modulations, such as AM, FM, PM, FSK, PSK, QAM, etc. We also implemented a simple modulator block for BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM modulations.

For the project of the course we were requested to implement a simple communication system, which would transmit a text message from one computer to another.

## Assignment 1
The [first assignment](assignment1/CS_330_Assignment_1_Introduction__GNU_Radio.pdf) was about getting familiar with GNU Radio and the different types of signals and modulations.

The [report](assignment1/report.pdf) of the assignment can be found in the assignment directory.

## Assignment 2
The [second assignment](assignment2/CS_330_Assignment_2_Introduction__Sampling__Nyquist_frequency__Aliasing.pdf) was about sampling, Nyquist frequency and aliasing. We were requested to implement a simple system that would sample a signal and then reconstruct it.

## Assignment 3
The [third assignment](assignment3/CS_330_Assignment_3_Resampling.pdf) was about resampling. We were requested to interleave a signal with 3 different methods. After interleaving the signal, we compared the results of the different methods and picked the best one.

## Assignment 4
The [fourth assignment](assignment4/CS_330_Assignment_4_2023_Modulation__Channel_Impairments.pdf) was about modulation and channel impairments. We experimented with different amounts of CFO and noise on a given modulated signal and we were requested to report by how much the CFO and noise affected the signal.

## Assignment 5
The [fifth assignment](assignment5/CS_330_Assignment_5_Modulation__GNU_Radio_Development.pdf) was about different modulations and GNU Radio block development. We were requested to implement a simple modulator block for BPSK, QPSK and 16-QAM modulations in a GNU Radio block.

The [report](assignment5/report.pdf) of the assignment can be found in the assignment directory.

## Project
The [project](project) was split into three phases: [Phase A](project/Phase_A___Project_2023.pdf), [Phase B](project/Phase_B___Project_2023.pdf) and [Phase C](project/Phase_C___Project_2023.pdf). Due to heavy workload i was not able to complete the project, but i managed to complete the first phase and make some significant progress on the rest.
